      <p>Like all sorts of entertainment, specifically vlogs, there will always be target audience.
        Our target audience are the students.
        There is a wide range of students but we targeted the middle schoolers (9-12 yrs old),
        high school students and college students (13-23 yrs old).
        As we conducted research about people who have the same issues or problem traits when it comes to productivity adults (24-35 yrs old) that are
        the ones who have the same issues.
        Even though we have our target audience, our vlog or Youtube content won't be limited for these groups of people.
        The vlog will be a video friendly to all.
